# My Personal Project

## Song Timer

My project will be a program that allows users 
to set the timing of songs in their library. 
Timing refers to the speed in beats per minute (BPM), as well as time signatures. 
This program
will be useful for rhythm games, where making levels often
requires knowing the BPM (and time signature) at any point in a song.

This project is of interest to me because I enjoy making levels in rhythm games
and find their timing editors to be lacking in functionality and ease of use,
specifically for songs with multiple BPM sections or non-standard
time signatures, typical in genres like jazz and math rock.



## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to know the BPM of a song
- As a user, I want to know the time signature at any point in a song
- As a user, I want to be able to add these songs to a 
library of timed songs
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple timing sections
to songs that cannot be accurately described in one
- As a user, I want to be able to select a song and see
all the timing sections in that song
