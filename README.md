# My Personal Project

## Song Timer

My project will be a program that allows users 
to set the timing of songs in their library. 
Timing refers to the speed in beats per minute (BPM), 
as well as a time signature (e.g 4/4). 
This program will be useful for rhythm games, where making levels often
requires knowing the BPM and time signature at any point in a song.

This project is of interest to me because I enjoy making levels in rhythm games
and find their timing editors to be lacking in functionality and ease of use,
specifically for songs with multiple BPM sections or non-standard
time signatures, typical in some of my favourite genres such as jazz and math rock.



## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to know the BPM of a song
- As a user, I want to know the time signature at any point in a song
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple timing sections
to songs that cannot be accurately described in one
- As a user, I want to be able to select a song and see
all the timing sections in that song
- As a user, I want to be able to save a song with all of its timing sections
- As a user, I want to be able to load a song with all of its timing sections
- As a user, when I start the application I want to be prompted to choose to load a song (or not, if I don't want to)
- As a user, when I close the application I want to be prompted to save the song (or not, if I don't want to)

## Instructions for Grader:
- You can add timing sections to a song by pressing the "Add Section" button and inputting the parameters.
- You can edit any timing section in a song by first selecting a timing section from the list and then pressing the "Edit Section" button
- The visual component of the program is the background image. It is the painting "Garden of Death" by Hugo Simberg. The painting is in public domain.
- You can save the state of my application by pressing the "File" menu button at the top of the screen and clicking "Save to..."
- You can reload the state of my application by either doing so when prompted on launch, or pressing "Load from..." in the "File" menu
